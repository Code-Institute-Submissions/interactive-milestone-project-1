Design

1. Colour Scheme
- The two main colours used on the site are blue and white. Using a dark and white color together contrasted nicely with the flow of the page.
2. Typography
- The 'Epilogue' font is the main font used throughout the website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font is not supported by the browser.

Wireframes

Map Page Wireframe - View

Mobile Wireframe - View

Languages Used

- HTML5

- This was the main language used and provided the website with semantic elements, giving each section a meaningful name, such as nav, section and footer to easily define.

- CSS3

Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used

Bootstrap 4.5
- Bootstrap is a CSS framework and used throughly throughout the website. The main target of using BootStrap within my site was to make it easier making the site responsive on mobile devices.

Google Fonts:
- Google fonts were used to import the 'Epilogue' font into the style.css file which is used on all pages throughout the project.

Font Awesome:
- Font Awesome was used on all pages throughout the website to add icons for aesthetic and UX purposes.

jQuery:
- jQuery is a feature of bootstrap to make the navbar responsive.
- jQuery was also used for the contact form to submit requests and responses to the browser.

Git
- Git was used for version control by utilizing the Gitpod terminal and initialising commands.

GitHub:
- GitHub is used to store the projects code after being commited from Gitpod.

Balsamiq:
- Balsamiq was used to create the wireframes during the design process. The Technologies that were used were new and updated versions of HTML and CSS.

Testing

- The W3C Markup Validator was a feature used to validate all html elements on each page.

- Whereas the W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate every snippet of css in the style sheet.

- These were both used to prevent mistakes and would run snytax errors if there was something wrong.

Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section
- First Time Visitor Goals

  i. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand main concept of the site and learn the intention of its relevance.
     
     - Upon entering the site, users are automatically greeted with a clean and easily readable bootstrap navigation bar to go to the page of their choice. Underneath there is a an Image of the developers face with Text "About Me".
    
     - The main points are made immediately with the image and the 'About me' header which is nicely centered and bold. The user now knows the site is about the developer, and gets a nice warm feeling like there smiling back at them to encourage them to read more information on the page.

Further Testing

- The website was tested on multiple browsers such as Microsoft Edge, Opera and FireFox, but the main one that was used was Chrome. This was because I was using the chrome extension at the time for gitpod and I felt chrome was fast and reliable.

- The website was viewed on iPhone SE, Android and laptop. There was also use of the developer tools as a faster way to look at the site becoming responsive such as using the example devices in the tools area. Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.
