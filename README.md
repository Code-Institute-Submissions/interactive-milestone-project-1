Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used

Bootstrap 4.5
- Bootstrap is a CSS framework and used throughly throughout the website. The main target of using BootStrap within my site was to make it easier making the site responsive on mobile devices.

Google Fonts:
- Google fonts were used to import the 'Epilogue' font into the style.css file which is used on all pages throughout the project.

Font Awesome:
- Font Awesome was used on all pages throughout the website to add icons for aesthetic and UX purposes.

jQuery:
- jQuery is a feature of bootstrap to make the navbar responsive.
- jQuery was also used for the contact form to submit requests and responses to the browser.

Git
- Git was used for version control by utilizing the Gitpod terminal and initialising commands.

GitHub:
- GitHub is used to store the projects code after being commited from Gitpod.

Balsamiq:
- Balsamiq was used to create the wireframes during the design process. The Technologies that were used were new and updated versions of HTML and CSS.

Testing

- The W3C Markup Validator was a feature used to validate all html elements on each page.

- Whereas the W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate every snippet of css in the style sheet.

- These were both used to prevent mistakes and would run snytax errors if there was something wrong.
